# Week 1: Hands-On Introduction to Data Engineering

## Overview
This hands-on workshop consists of two parts, Python programming and SQL. The Python programming part will introduce you to the basics of Python programming, including data types, variables, operators, and control structures. The SQL part will cover the basics of SQL, including data definition, data manipulation, and data querying.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Write Python programs to perform basic data processing tasks.
- Write SQL queries to create, update, and query databases.

## Activities
